# Rimmington Oak Chopper
- Requires 15 woodcutting, coins, an axe, a servant (Cook or above), and a bell pull in your house
- Supports 3 ticking with guam/marrentill or teak logs
- Disable level up dialogs
- Uses PoH servant to bank oaks, can turn them into planks automatically too. Great for irons!
- If you have less gp, there's an option to have the servant bank them without turning them into 
  planks
- A butler is the best servant for this if you are 3 ticking, otherwise use a demon butler
